This repo contains a jupyter notebook for the research:
EXPLORING FURTHER RELATIONS OF METRICAL STRENGTH ANDPITCH RELATIONS IN TURKISH MAKAM MUSIC 

In this research we further develop the research of Holzapfelet et al [1]
exploring  the  reinforcement  of  meter  in  the music of Turkish Makam. 
Our research follows a similar methodology to that described by Holzapfel, 
deriving note onset  distributions  which  we  subsequently  correlate  to 
weighted usul histograms used  to  formalise  meter.   

In partcicular, we aim to answer three main questions:
RQ1 - To  what  extent  are  the  findings  andconclusions drawn in Holzapfel et alâ€™s work reproducible on  a different  data-set?   
RQ2 - To  what degree  does thechoice ofmakamalso act to reinforce or diminish metricalstrength?  
RQ3 - To what extent do pitch relations acrossmakamswith differingusulsact to also reinforce metre?

We find  the  results  of  [1]  to  be  reproducible  such  that  our research  is  able  to  identify  similar 
correlation  patterns across all usul considered. 
Consistent correlation variation acros smakams are also identified.  
In addition, our work goes  further  to  assess  the  extent  to  which  pitch  is  used to  reinforce  
metrical  structure  in makam (to  the  best  ofour knowledge,  not previously addressed in past works).
Although no immediate patterns are identified, we suggest subsequent developments which could be made in future works  to 
further  explore  the  role  of  pitch  in  metricalreinforcement.
